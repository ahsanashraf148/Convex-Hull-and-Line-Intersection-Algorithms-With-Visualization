# Convex-Hull-and-Line-Intersection-Algorithms-With-Visualization

## The AlgorithmProject.pynb file contains both convex hull as well as line intersection algorithms

## Convex Hull Algorithms:
- Graham Scan Algorithm
- Jarvis March or Gift Wrapping Algorithm
- Bruteforce Algorithm
- Quick Hull
- My own researched and Implemented Algorithm

## Line Intersection Algorithms
- CCW
- Cramers Method
- Vector Product
